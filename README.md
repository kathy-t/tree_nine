# Tree Nine
Put diff files on an existing phylogenetic tree using [UShER](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-021-00862-7)'s `usher sampled` task with a bit of help from [SRANWRP](https://www.github.com/aofarrel/SRANWRP), followed by conversion to taxonium and Nextstrain/Auspice formats. Auspice sometimes struggles to load a large bacterial phylo tree, so there is the option to output subtrees instead of one very large tree.

Verified on Terra-Cromwell and miniwdl. Make sure to add `--copy-input-files` for miniwdl. Default inputs assume you're working with _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_, be sure to change them if you aren't working with that bacterium.

<sup>†</sup>does not directly set the `threads` value for usher, but by default usher will use all available cores  
<sup>‡</sup>a sample .pb created from SRA data is present in this repo and the Docker image used by this workflow, and it will be the fallback input mat if not provided by the user -- **but this default tree should only be used for debugging purposes** 


## how to remove samples with bad coverage
If you created your diff files using [myco](https://github.com/aofarrel/myco), report files will be output alongside your diff files. Put these reports in as **coverage_reports** and set **max_low_coverage_sites** as the lowpass threshold for which you want to filter out files. For example, if you want to get rid of any sample for which has 5% or more low coverage sites, set **max_low_coverage_sites** to 0.05

## output trees
* tree_usher_raw: .pb (protobuff) formatted tree with your new samples. Unlike all other tree outputs, this tree will **not** be rerooted if `reroot_to_this_node` is not None.
* tree_usher_rerooted: The post-reroot version of tree_usher_raw. This output does not exist if `reroot_to_this_node` is None.
* tree_nwk: .nwk (newick) formatted tree.
* tree_nextstrain: .json formatted tree compatiable with Nextstrain Auspice. Note that Auspice might struggle to view large bacterial trees depending on how powerful your computer is.
* subtrees_nextstrain: .json formatted subtrees compatiable with Nextstrain Auspice. These subtrees are focused on newly added samples, and may be more performant in Auspice than the overall tree.
* tree_taxonium: .json.gz formatted tree compatiable with [Taxonium](https://taxonium.org/).
